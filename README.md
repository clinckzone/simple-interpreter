# Setup for local development

In the project directory, you can run:

```js
npm install
```

- You don't really need this since I forgot to add a .gitignore file.
- But do it just in case something goes wrong.

```js
node server.js
```

- Runs the server.js file in the project.
- Open http://localhost:8000 to view it in the browser.
- The page won't magically reload if you make edits. You will have to restart the server.
